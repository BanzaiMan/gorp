# The following is code that was a part of Rails 2.3.*, but was removed in 3.0:
#
# http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/2-3-stable/railties/lib/initializer.rb#L217
#
# What it does is ensure that requires of things like 'active_script' are
# satisfied by the vendored rails, and not by whatever gems you have
# installed.
#
# if vendor/rails is not present, the provided boot.rb procedure will be run
# unchanged.  If bundler is ever run on this application, this file will be
# overwritten, and therefore will not interfere with bundling operations.
